We are excited to continue one of our favourite traditions: The Trinity Term Exchange Dinner.

Weâ€™re looking forward to jointly hosting a formal dinner with the OU Gernan Society, enjoy great food and drinks, while spreading some European spirit with our close neighbours.

Tickets will become available in Week 2 of the term - exclusively for members of the German and Italian Societies.

We look forward to seeing you there!
