Don't miss our final event of the term! We will have copious amounts of Italian food and wine including a number of different "pasta fredda" bowls as well as lots of nibbles and starters including fresh Sicilian cannoli. Italian red and white wines will also be available as well as our delicious Aperol Spritz!

Entry is cash only on the door at £3 for members and £8 for non members. All members will be eligible to vote for next year's committee! Membership can, naturally, be purchased on the door.

Hilary term also means new committee! Federico, Francesco and Emma bow out after a long year. Please come and show your support for our new candidates.

If you've enjoyed any of our events this year, do swing by! If you're interested in running for election contact us at: italy.society@studentclubs.ox.ac.uk
