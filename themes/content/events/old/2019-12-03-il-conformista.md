[Il Conformista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conformist_(1970_film))

For this term's movie nights, we're partnering up with [Films For Europe-Oxford](https://www.facebook.com/FilmsForEurope/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC2lbcFqkbEBbWdUQNPh2u5qmUZg8dL4YYFHd9mQk73nBPmYfJzfeLQdWBpjFvw8i4n19pGiX5CgV4tVkfE0B6WcGaFGpAAItj7QGfNcqvE34kSOQDUGBvKTidIuyr2PBZ3U17WvVbg5q7vbVllU4uSuY1MkUSCfr2BwuzxOtKtJVPsAYMhMzis0HQjgl4bKBtF6dDd8yHZGuYCqz-t1B8sxKJrxy2IQgp7r_pVI6R4LP5qlHojmWkc7QSOD_Ht40hvRutScWlrEWt2Zv3p_8NlYH9cd0yaLQR9pcV99yB9r61fzsEYFCWSHnQ0J2HB2vNPkOBVr9xrnWBPdW5kvDc&eid=ARBCZpFjS1Vc0zhLqo_noZZjtBzM0R9sC9XW0sbKSQVx7-IV9awT7yaREtA2RjPq8E_iXt_o7lXM6m2l), to guide you through some of the most important Italian contributions to postwar cinema. All events are free entry, and open to everyone!

For our last film of term, it is only right to reach an end to our exploration of Italian film with the influential hit, _The Conformist_. Bertolucci's film is a collective expression of its cinematic ancestors: the tension of Elio Petri, the charm of the '30s, the fashion of postwar Divos and Divas, a heritage that, owing to Bertolucci, would conserve Italy's place in world cinema, and influence directors to come.

Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1970 thriller follows the life of Marcello, a fascist assassin under Mussolini, up to the year 1943. Noted for its depiction of the luxuries of Italian high society and its delineated narrative, which would go on to be a major influence in Hollywood, most obviously for other Italians like Ford-Coppola, Bertolucci’s film appears very modern. Godard condemned _The Conformist_ for its weak politics and for many the religious and psycho-sexual complexes of Marcello may play out unconvincingly, but ultimately Bertolucci is an emotional director, observable in his expressionistic mise en scene, and the film is a beautiful one.
