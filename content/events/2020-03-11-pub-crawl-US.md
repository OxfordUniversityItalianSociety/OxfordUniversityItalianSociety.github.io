Italian, Americans, Italo-americans, and none of the above: all are welcome! We are joining the Oxford American Society on a pub crawl!

We will start from Kings Arms, but will be roaming around several other pubs as well. Feel free to join us at any of the stops - we will post in the event where we are and when we are going.

Current plan:
- Kings Arms
- The Crown on Cornmarket street 
- Four Candles
