### Event cancelled

Many of our members (and members of the Italian community more generally) are going through a difficult time and we have decided to cancel this event. Please consider [donating](https://it.gofundme.com/c/act/insieme-contro-il-coronavirus?fbclid=IwAR1kWsmDzzK7uxK0x_Jut2lAMebxaiMK2FszINBuRczOlX6dAKx-MUpSyds) what you would have spent this evening to help us overcome the current crisis.

~~Italian, Americans, Italo-americans, and none of the above: all are welcome! We are joining the Oxford American Society on a pub crawl!~~

~~We will start from Kings Arms, but will be roaming around several other pubs as well. Feel free to join us at any of the stops - we will post in the event where we are and when we are going.~~

~~Current plan:~~
- ~~Kings Arms~~
- ~~The Crown on Cornmarket street~~
- ~~Four Candles~~
