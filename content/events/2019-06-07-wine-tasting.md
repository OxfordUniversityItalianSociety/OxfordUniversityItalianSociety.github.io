Join us and our friends from the Wine Tasting Society as we embark on a journey. We will try five fine wines from the Colli Euganei (in the Veneto region) including one Spumante, one white and three reds.

[Vigna RÃ²da](http://www.vignaroda.com/products), our excellent providers, are delighting us with the following wines:

- [Fior D'Arancio](http://www.vignaroda.com/products/spumante/fior-darancio-colli-euganei-spumante) 
- [Aroma 2.0](http://www.vignaroda.com/products/white-wines/aroma-2-0-euganean-hills-moscato) 
- [Espero](http://www.vignaroda.com/espero-colli-euganei-cabernet) 
- [Scarlatto](http://www.vignaroda.com/scarlatto-colli-euganei-rosso) 
- [Il Damerino](http://www.vignaroda.com/il-damerino-colli-euganei-merlot) 


Each bottle will be paired with a piece by Vivaldi, the region's greatest composer.
