[Il Sorpasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Sorpasso)

For this term's movie nights, we're partnering up with [Films For Europe-Oxford](https://www.facebook.com/FilmsForEurope/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC2lbcFqkbEBbWdUQNPh2u5qmUZg8dL4YYFHd9mQk73nBPmYfJzfeLQdWBpjFvw8i4n19pGiX5CgV4tVkfE0B6WcGaFGpAAItj7QGfNcqvE34kSOQDUGBvKTidIuyr2PBZ3U17WvVbg5q7vbVllU4uSuY1MkUSCfr2BwuzxOtKtJVPsAYMhMzis0HQjgl4bKBtF6dDd8yHZGuYCqz-t1B8sxKJrxy2IQgp7r_pVI6R4LP5qlHojmWkc7QSOD_Ht40hvRutScWlrEWt2Zv3p_8NlYH9cd0yaLQR9pcV99yB9r61fzsEYFCWSHnQ0J2HB2vNPkOBVr9xrnWBPdW5kvDc&eid=ARBCZpFjS1Vc0zhLqo_noZZjtBzM0R9sC9XW0sbKSQVx7-IV9awT7yaREtA2RjPq8E_iXt_o7lXM6m2l), to guide you through some of the most important Italian contributions to postwar cinema. All events are free entry, and open to everyone!

_Commedia all'Italiana_ - _comedy Italian-style_ - was an extremely popular genre in Italy towards the end of the Fifties and throughout the Sixties. As the country entered an Age of Affluence, the basic values of Italian society - marriage, friendship, family - came under serious questioning. 

Perhaps the greatest example of this genre is Dino Risi's _Il Sorpasso_ (1962).  Italian legend Vittorio Gassman plays the uproariously whimsical and scandalous Bruno - the stereotype of the easygoing _Romano_; a title carrying more connotations than just a citizen of Rome - whilst French mainstay Jean-Louis Trintignant takes the role of the prudish law student taken for a never-ending spin through Rome after a chance encounter with Bruno. With all the action in the iconic Lancia Spider, _Il Sorpasso_ is a hilarious film, yet always pointing, melancholically, to the risks of taking too many chances, one after another.
