We are excited to present to you all our next event, organised in conjunction with 10+ Italian societies and the Italian Embassy in London. This is a prime opportunity to get to know your Embassy better, from how it's structured to the important work they do.\
Join us on Thursday 8th April at 6 PM BST for a conversation with the Ambassador of Italy to the UK, Raffaele Trombetta. After a 20 min presentation about the Embassy you will have a chance to ask questions in our Q&A.\
