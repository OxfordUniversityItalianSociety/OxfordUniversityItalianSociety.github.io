[8 1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8%C2%BD)

For this term's movie nights, we're partnering up with [Films For Europe-Oxford](https://www.facebook.com/FilmsForEurope/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC2lbcFqkbEBbWdUQNPh2u5qmUZg8dL4YYFHd9mQk73nBPmYfJzfeLQdWBpjFvw8i4n19pGiX5CgV4tVkfE0B6WcGaFGpAAItj7QGfNcqvE34kSOQDUGBvKTidIuyr2PBZ3U17WvVbg5q7vbVllU4uSuY1MkUSCfr2BwuzxOtKtJVPsAYMhMzis0HQjgl4bKBtF6dDd8yHZGuYCqz-t1B8sxKJrxy2IQgp7r_pVI6R4LP5qlHojmWkc7QSOD_Ht40hvRutScWlrEWt2Zv3p_8NlYH9cd0yaLQR9pcV99yB9r61fzsEYFCWSHnQ0J2HB2vNPkOBVr9xrnWBPdW5kvDc&eid=ARBCZpFjS1Vc0zhLqo_noZZjtBzM0R9sC9XW0sbKSQVx7-IV9awT7yaREtA2RjPq8E_iXt_o7lXM6m2l), to guide you through some of the most important Italian contributions to postwar cinema. All events are free entry, and open to everyone!

_The greatest film to have ever been made_. More probable than arguable. Need we say more?

Federico Fellini, right from 1953, promised to be Italy's, and the World's greatest director. Technically masterful, but above all a visionary film, _8 1/2_ is his attempt at beating writer's block. Marcello Mastroianni, flanked by the uniquely blinding Claudia Cardinale, delivers the performance of a career as he plays Fellini's alter-ego. Nino Rota scores a simply unbeatable, dizzying soundtrack. Surrealist yet personal, there is nothing to say that would do this film justice.
