title : Italian Academia - Challenges and Opportunities
---

Italian academia has undergone significant changes in the last ten years following the wholesale reform of the sector in 2010. What has changed? What has stayed the same? And more to the point: what are the opportunities for Italian and foreign researchers who might want to complete their doctoral studies or pursue an academic career in Italy? This hands-on seminar will present a succinct explanation of where we stand, an extended Q&A session will try to answer as many questions as possible in a technical and detailed manner.

SPEAKER: Matteo Legrenzi is Associate Professor of International Relations at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice. He holds a D.Phil. in International Relations and a M.Phil. in Modern Middle Eastern Studies from St. Antony's College, Oxford.
