Introducing our next guest, founder of Torcha, Marco Cartasegna. 
After graduating with a degree in Economics and Management at Bocconi University in Milan, and completing a specialisation in Management and Digital Business in Madrid, Marco Cartasegna founded Torcha in the spring of 2020. 
Torcha is based on providing reliable information on social media. Their aim is informing young people about current events, politics and economics in a simple and understandable way. 
While their objective is making news approachable to the younger generations, their content and format are produced by journalists, economists and professionals who are experts in their sector, making Torcha a reliable source of information.
