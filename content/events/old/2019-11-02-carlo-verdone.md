OUIS is proud to welcome M.o Carlo Verdone, who will present his 2006 film [Il mio Miglior Nemico](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_mio_miglior_nemico_(film_2006)). The film will be shown in between Mr Verdone's initial address and a post-film Q&A session. 

We are honoured to be able to host one of Italy's most renowned artists and hope to see you all there.
This event will be held entirely in Italian.

**Tickets are now sold out**. We regret we could not accommodate all of you. If you are among the lucky ones, please remember to take the ticket with you and be ready to show it at the event, as **entry will not be allowed without a ticket**.
