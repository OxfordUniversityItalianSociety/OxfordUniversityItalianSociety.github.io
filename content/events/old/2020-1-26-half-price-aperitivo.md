Welcome back! We start the term with our classic aperitivo. Given the HUGE success of last time, we have reduced capacity and slightly changed the format of our event.

At £7.90, you will be able to enjoy 4 slices of pizza as well as a Spritz of your choosing. On top of this you will be able to enjoy fabulous discounts on all drinks and snacks:

- 4 more slices of pizza at £3.90
- Limoncello at £3 instead of £5
- White wine at £4.50 instead of £5.90
- Red wine at £4.50 instead of £5.90
- Prosecco at £4.50 instead of £5.90
- Beer from £3.50 instead of £4.90
- Wine bottles at £15 instead of £21
- Further SPRITZ at £4.90 instead of £7
