OUIS is delighted to be welcoming former Minister, Professor Elsa Fornero.

She will address the audience discussing her incredibly influential role in government as well as her thoughts, expectations and hopes for the future. Her address will be followed by a Q&A session.

The event will be entirely held in English.

This will be a great chance to ask a world leading expert about the current Italian and European political and economic situation.

This event is free for OUIS members and shall cost Â£3 on entry for non-members. Membership may, as always, be purchased on the door.

Dinner with Professor Fornero - formal hall at New College - will also be available via ballot. To ballot please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/4WyYrbUAToxJL5zz6).
