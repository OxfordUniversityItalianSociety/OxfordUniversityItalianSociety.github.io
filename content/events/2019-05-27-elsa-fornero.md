Our second speaker for this term is former Minister Elsa Fornero.

Whether you are a huge fan or whether she prevented your parents and grandparents from retiring, it will be a great chance to ask a world leading expert about the current Italian and European political and economic situation.

As someone who has been in a central figure in Italian politics for almost a decade, we are lucky to have her address our members.

Dinner with Professor Fornero will also be available via ballot.
