We are delighted to be hosting our first speaker of the term: Roberto d'Agostino

As a pioneer in the world of Italian tabloid journalism and one of the first to understand the potential of the web, this is certainly shaping up to be an interesting and delightfully provocative event! 

An opening statement will be followed by a Q&A session. The event will be translated into English simultaneously. 

This event is free to all OUIS members. Non-members will be asked to pay Â£2.
