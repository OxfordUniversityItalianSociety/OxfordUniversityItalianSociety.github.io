OUIS is proud to welcome M.o Carlo Verdone, who will present his 2006 film [Il mio Miglior Nemico](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_mio_miglior_nemico_(film_2006)). The film will be shown in between Mr Verdone's initial address and a post-film Q&A session. 

We are honoured to be able to host one of Italy's most renowned artists and hope to see you all there.

This event will be held entirely in Italian. Please follow the facebook page for updates regarding tickets. We will share more information closer to the date of the event.
