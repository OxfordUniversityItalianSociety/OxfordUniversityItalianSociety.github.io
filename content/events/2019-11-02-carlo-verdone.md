OUIS is proud to welcome M.o Carlo Verdone, who will present his 2006 film [Il mio Miglior Nemico](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_mio_miglior_nemico_(film_2006)). The film will be shown in between Mr Verdone's initial address and a post-film Q&A session. 

We are honoured to be able to host one of Italy's most renowned artists and hope to see you all there.

This event will be held entirely in Italian.

Tickets will be allocated as follows:

1. IF YOU ARE A CARD-HOLDING MEMBER OF THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY ITALIAN SOCIETY: A members ballot will be used to allocate a first tier of tickets. This is exclusively for our members. Do not submit a request for these tickets if you are not a registered card-holding member of OUIS. You will be asked the term in which your membership expires. If it matches our records, your name will be put into the ballot. Results of the ballot will be communicated to our members via email on Wednesday 16 October. Ballot winners tickets will be free of charge. The ballot is now open and the link for the ballot is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqLWj1c3rVR0fPXG7B895eezYtH3WLUsPwROt3I0cKvfnYEA/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1).

These tickets will be put on sale at 11 am (UK time) on Saturday 19 October. No more than two tickets can be purchased in one transaction.

Please note: we have selected one the college’s most spacious venues. Places are nonetheless limited, so nobody is guaranteed a place. We expect tickets to sell out in less than five minutes and do not accept responsibility if you cannot complete the purchase.

Please note: entry will not be allowed without a ticket. 

Please note: not all members in the ballot will be allocated a ticket.
