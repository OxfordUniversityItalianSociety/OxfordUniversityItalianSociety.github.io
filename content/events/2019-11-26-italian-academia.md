title : Italian Academia - Challenges and Opportunities
---

The great Prof. Matteo Legrenzi who exported Oxford's PPE and came up with Ca' Foscari's incredibly successful PISE course, will be discussing opportunities in the world of Italian accademia. 

This talk is meant and thought primarily for postgraduate students who seek opportunities to further their studies in Italy. 

Prof. Legrenzi has immeasurable experience as well as deep knowledge on higher education systems in many different countries. We hope to see you there.
